## Model selection guide
some comes in different sizes. Choosing the right model size in Ollama depends on your hardware, use case, and performance requirements. Hereâ€™s a breakdown to help you decide:


Key Factors to Consider
- Hardware Specifications
- RAM: More RAM allows for larger models and better performance.
- GPU vs CPU: Some models can leverage GPU acceleration (if supported).
- Power Consumption: Smaller models consume less power, making them more efficient for laptops.

Use Case
- Chatbot & Casual Use: Small models work well.
- Coding Assistance & Research: Medium models provide a balance of speed vs capability.
- Deep NLP & Creative AI Tasks: Large models offer more accuracy & depth.

## Ollama Terminal vs. Web UI ‚Äì Why Use the Open Web UI?
Ollama is powerful, but using it in the terminal has some limitations:

- No History ‚Äì Conversations reset every time you restart.
- Limited Formatting ‚Äì No rich text, images, or structured responses.
- Hard to Manage Long Interactions ‚Äì Scrolling through long outputs in the terminal isn‚Äôt ideal.
- Less User-Friendly ‚Äì Running models via CLI requires manual commands.

### Set up Open Web UI for a Better Experience!
- Chat history & better response formatting üìù
- Easier multi-turn conversations üí¨
- More interactive & visually structured üñ•Ô∏è
- No need to type commands each time!
